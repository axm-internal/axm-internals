# @axm-internal/git-db

Version: 0.1.0

Purpose:
- SQLite-backed index of git commits and file changes for fast queries.

Public surface:
- `openNodeDb`, `openBunDb`, `openBunWorkerDb`
- `findCommitsByMessage`, `findCommitsBetween`, `findCommitsByAuthorEmail`
- `findCommitsByPath`, `findCommitsByPackage`, `findAuthors`
- Types: `DbClient`, `RepoIndexState`, `Author`, `Commit`, `CommitFile`, `MetaEntry`

Intended usage:
- Internal tooling that needs fast commit/path queries over a cached git index.

Non-goals:
- Running git commands on every query.
- Replacing git history or release tooling.

Stability expectations:
- Early-stage API; expect changes before 1.0.
