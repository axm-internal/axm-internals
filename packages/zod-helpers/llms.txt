# @axm-internal/zod-helpers

Version: 0.1.0

Purpose:
- Provide Zod v4 schemas for common runtime instances.

Public surface:
- `AxiosInstanceSchema`
- `PinoInstanceSchema`

Intended usage:
- Validate runtime instances with `safeParse` before using them.
- Use `AxiosInstanceSchema` to guard Axios-like clients.
- Use `PinoInstanceSchema` to guard Pino loggers passed into helpers.

Non-goals:
- Wrapping Axios or Pino APIs.
- Replacing full type definitions for those libraries.

Stability expectations:
- Pre-1.0; breaking changes may occur in minor releases.
