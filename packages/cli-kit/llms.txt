# @axm-internal/cli-kit

Version: 0.1.0

Purpose:
- Provide typed, validated CLI command definitions on top of Commander
- Offer lightweight logging and optional dependency container utilities for CLI apps

Public surface:
- `CliApp` class for configuring and running a CLI app
- `createCommandDefinition` for typed command definitions with Zod schemas
- `CliLogger` constant for logger resolution/use
- `InMemoryContainer` and `ContainerInterface`/`InjectionToken` for lightweight DI
- `CliOutputService` and `CliOutputServiceInterface` for output handling
- Types: `CliAppParams`, `CliConfig`, `CliOptions`, `CommandContext`, `CommandContextForSchemas`, `CommandAction`, `CommandDefinition`

Intended usage:
- Define Commander-based CLIs with Zod-validated args and options
- Compose commands and run them through `CliApp`
- Use optional container and logger in command actions

Non-goals:
- Replacing Commander or providing a full CLI framework
- Providing a full-featured dependency injection system
- Generating build artifacts or bundling

Stability expectations:
- Pre-1.0 API; expect breaking changes as the package evolves
- Semver applies; changesets track published versions
