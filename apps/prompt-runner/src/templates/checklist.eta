Run the package at <%= it.packagePath %> through monorepo-docs/package-checklist.md.

Before reporting, run these scripts inside the package directory:
- bun run test
- bun run docs
- bun run lint
- bun run check-types

Output requirements:
- Output only the checklist report content (no preface, no next steps).
- Use the exact section headers:
  - Completed items
  - Missing items
  - Unknown/unverified items
- Use bullet lists under each section.

Write the report to <%= it.outputPath %>.
